# Optimization-Robot-Control-assignment3
This repository contains the code and documents for the final project of master course Optimization Robot Control.
We delve into the problem of optimal control and stabilization of both the pendulum and double pendulum systems. The pendulum system, consisting
of a mass attached to a fixed pivot point, exhibits complex dynamics that require sophisticated control strategies to achieve desired objectives. 
In this specific scenario, our objective is to bring the pendulum to an upright position. We achieved this result by utilizing the powerful Deep Q-Network (DQN)
algorithm. The DQN algorithm has gained substantial popularity due to its ability to learn control policies directly from raw sensory inputs, 
making it an ideal choice for addressing complex control problems such as this one. 

More details can be found in the project report.
